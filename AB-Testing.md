# A/B Testing Approach

To implement A/B testing for the CTA button color on the landing page:

1. **Define Variants**  
   - Version A: CTA button with the original color (e.g., blue).  
   - Version B: CTA button with an alternative color (e.g., green).  

2. **Traffic Split**  
   - Randomly assign 50% of users to Variant A and 50% to Variant B.  
   - This can be done on the server-side (e.g., by setting a cookie or a query parameter) or via a client-side A/B testing library.  

3. **Tracking & Metrics**  
   - Collect user interactions (e.g., button clicks, conversions) using analytics tools (Google Analytics or a custom backend log).  
   - Ensure events are tracked consistently across both variants.  

4. **Evaluation**  
   - Compare the conversion rate of Variant A vs Variant B.  
   - Use statistical significance testing to determine if the observed difference is meaningful.  

5. **Rollout**  
   - If Variant B performs better, update the landing page to use that version by default.  
   - Optionally, continue testing with additional variations for further optimization.
